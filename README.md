# Notesz

> Open-source note taking app that stores your notes on GitHub

👉 Live app: [https://notesz.app](https://notesz.app)


Add it to your Home Screen on your phone to use it like a native app. It works offline, and all your data is synced directly from the browser to GitHub, no third party involved.

## About

I created *Notesz* as a personal project. My goal was to create a simple, serverless, progressive web app (PWA) for note-taking that stores everything on GitHub, and also works well on phones. I'm trying my best to deliver a user experience as close to a native mobile app as possible with web technologies.

I'm still deciding on how I'd like to handle collaboration, but feel free to create discussions or issues if you run into bugs.

> Fun fact: “Notesz” means “pocket notebook” in Hungarian. It's pronounced “not-ass”, IPA: /ˈnotɛs/.
